Simple Artist/Album/Track/Lyric web scraper utilizing BeautifulSoup to parse Wikipedia, AZLyrics, and Songlyrics.com

Current hit rate as of March 11, 2022

TODO:
1. Resolve accenting - websites simply drop the accents rather than accepting URI encoded characters
2. Resolve TypeErroring in parse_tracks - this should be raising AttributeErrors if the object doesn't exist, so some conditional type conversion may need to take place to resolve this
3. Implement unittesting functionality
4. Create handler for parsing only artists that have no albums and albums that have no tracks - use LEFT JOIN on IDs where album_title and track_title IS NULL
5. Move from html.parser to LXML for ~25% speedup
6. Backtracking refactor (page by page stepping)
7. Consider edge-case handling by headless chrome instance (Playwright)
